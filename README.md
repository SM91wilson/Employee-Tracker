# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project was to create an employee tracking system using node, MySQL, console.table and inquirer.

MySQL was used to create and populate tables that will contain the employees, the departments, and the employee roles.
The Inquirer is used to build menus from which the user can choose what to do and to allow the user to input values for adding roles or employees.
Console.table is then used to present the employess in a table when selected from the menu.

This program allows the user to keep track of all current employees and the roles within departments while allowing updates to be made to roles or emplyees depending on the needs of the user.

## Installation

npm i will install all dependencies and node server will run the program.
